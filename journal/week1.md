# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

To containerize the project we will do the following
- clone the project repo to our local machine 
- make sure both apps are running fine locally 
- create a Dockerfle for each one

## Containerize the Frontend

Switch to the frontend directory and create a dockerfile

```bash
cd frontend-react-js

nano Dockerfile
```

Populate the Dockerfile you just created with the following instructions

```dockerfile
FROM node:16.18

ENV PORT=3000

COPY . /frontend-react-js

WORKDIR /frontend-react-js

RUN rm -rf node_modules \
    && npm install

EXPOSE ${PORT}

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```


## Containerize the Backend

To containerize the backend do the following

Switch to the backend directory and create a dockerfile

```bash
cd backend-flask

nano Dockerfile
```

Populate the Dockerfile you just created with the following instructions
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development \
    FRONTEND_URL="*" \
    BACKEND_URL="*" \
    PORT=4567

EXPOSE ${PORT}

CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
```
